## ⚡ How It Works: 3 Simple Steps

MPG makes bulk page creation fast and easy—ideal for beginners and scalable for agencies.

### 📋 Step 1: Upload Your Data
Import your spreadsheet (CSV, XLSX, ODS) or connect a live Google Sheet. 
Each row = a unique page.

**Example:**

`city:` New York  
`service:` Plumbing  
`price:` $150  
`phone:` (555) 123-0001      

### 🎨 Step 2: Create Your Template
- Pick any Entity type, i.e., page or post.
- Design your page template.
- Insert placeholders like `{{mpg_city}}`, `{{mpg_service}}`, `{{mpg_price}}`.

**Example Template:**
- **Title:** Professional {{mpg_service}} in {{mpg_city}}
- **Content:** Need reliable {{mpg_service}} in {{mpg_city}}? Call {{mpg_phone}} for a quote from {{mpg_price}}.
- **Set URL patterns:** /services/{{mpg_service}}/{{mpg_city}}/
